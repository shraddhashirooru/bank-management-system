# üè¶ Bank Management System (Python Project)

A simple yet functional **Bank Management System** built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This CLI-based application allows users to manage their bank accounts with features like deposits, withdrawals, transaction history, and admin access.

**Key Highlight:**  
All account and transaction data are stored persistently in a local `bank_data.json` file using JSON serialization.  
This means that data is preserved even after closing the program, making the system more realistic and practical than many beginner-level banking simulations.

##  Features:

#### Customer Functionalities:
- Create **Savings** or **Current** account
- Deposit and withdraw money
- View balance and transaction history
- Change account password
- Delete account

#### Admin Functionalities:
- View all customer accounts (admin access protected)

#### Security:
- Password-protected accounts
- Admin access requires a secret code

## Technologies & Libraries:

- **Python 3.x**
- `tabulate` ‚Äî for neat tabular formatting
- `json` ‚Äî to persist data across runs
- `datetime` ‚Äî for transaction timestamps

## OOP Concepts Used:

| Concept                 | How it's used                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Class & Object**     | BankAccount, SavingAccount, CurrentAccount, and BankSystem classes            |
| **Encapsulation**      | Attributes like `password`, `balance` are protected via methods               |
| **Inheritance**        | SavingAccount and CurrentAccount inherit from `BankAccount`                   |
| **Polymorphism**       | `withdraw()` overridden in child classes                                      |
| **Abstraction**        | `deposit()`, `withdraw()` hide implementation details                         |
